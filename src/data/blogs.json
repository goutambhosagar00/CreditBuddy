    "content": "<p>Let’s be real — school teaches us trigonometry and thermodynamics, but not how to handle money. Most of us learn the hard way — borrowing from friends, overspending, or ignoring savings.</p><p>That’s where financial literacy comes in. Knowing how to plan your expenses, repay on time, and save even ₹100 a week can completely change your college journey.</p><p>At CreditBuddy, we believe money skills should be as common as coding or communication. Our goal is to make finance simple, fun, and rewarding — because confidence with money starts young.</p><blockquote>“Learn money before you earn money — that’s what sets you apart.”</blockquote>",
